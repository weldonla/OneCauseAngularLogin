# OneCauseAngularLogin

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). I wanted to implement testing for the auth service, but couldn't get async
functions to run without timing out (see comments in authentication.service.spec).

## Sources
This Angular project is adapted from the [following project](https://github.com/cornflourblue/angular-8-registration-login-example).
